  <h2> Bar </h2>
    <h3><b>If We're Open, So Is The Bar!</b></h3>
      <p>Whether we're hosting TCG groups, Gaming groups, or Pool groups, the bar is open for all customers that are 21+. 
          If we find someone under 21 drinking, them and their group will be asked to immediately leave the premises. The bar is a privilege 
          and it's to help amplify the fun! We're here to create fun oportunities for the community! Have fun and drink responsibly!</p>

  <h2> Pool </h2>
    <h3><b>APA, Private, or Recreational</b></h3>
      <p>We are happy to have the opportunity to host a wide variety of events for the pool players in our community! We host APA and 
          private tournaments! If you're wanting to host a private tournament, contact us for more information. We also encourage novice

  <h2> Gaming </h2>
    <h3><b>Private Events</b></h3>
      <p>Our gaming space is available to rent out for groups to enjoy! We have PS5, Xbox Series X, and the Nintendo Switch 2! 
          If you would like to suggest games for us to purchase to add to our library, we send out a Google Form across our platforms 
          and tally up the votes for each system. Whatever games get the most votes, will be purchased for their respective systems. 
          If you want to play a game that isn't currently on our system, you will need to bring a copy of the game.</p>
    <h3><b>Competitive</b></h3>
      <p>Along with hosting private events, we will also hold tournaments for popular game titles such as Super Smash, Mario Kart, 
          Madden, and others. Measures to prevent cheating on titles will be taken into account such as having multiple consoles and 
          screens. Contact us for more information on tournament rules and the full list of games we will be hosting.</p>

  <h2> TCG (Casual and Competitive)</h2>
    <h3><b>Saturday Magic</b></h3>
      <p>On Saturdays, we will host Magic The Gathering from 12pm - 8pm. We will have deisgnated tables for 
          commander and standard formats. It is meant to be a casual atmosphere, however, bring your strongest 
          deck and start a high bracket table at your own risk! </p>
    <h3><b>Sunday Pokemon</b></h3>
      <p>On Sundays, we will host Pokemon from 12pm - 8pm. Same as magic, this is meant for a casual and fun 
        atmosphere, however, you can get as competitive as your group wants! We will have multiple tables set 
        up for the TCG game, but we will also have tables designated for trading and showing off your collections!</p>
